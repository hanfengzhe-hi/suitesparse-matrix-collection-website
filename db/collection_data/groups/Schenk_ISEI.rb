This page contains links to test data that we used to test our iterative and
direct parallel solvers projects. Within these projects, new parallel
algorithms and software for the solution of sparse systems of linear equations
will be developed. These include algorithms for direct solution, iterative
solution based on multilevel and domain decomposition methods, and for
preconditioning.

All matrices come with right-hand-sides.  Many of the matrices have
many explicit zero entries.
