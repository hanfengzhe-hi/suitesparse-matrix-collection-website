GRAHAM1		Obtained Feb. 18, 1998.
		Jacobian from a Galerkin finite element discretization of
		the Navier-Stokes equations applied to a two-phase fluid flow
		problem.

		Original problem was in finite-element (unassembled) form.
		When converted to RUA type, 93877 entries with duplicate
		row & column indices were summed.
