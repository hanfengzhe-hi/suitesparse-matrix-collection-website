    notes: 'Linear programming, lower bounds for quadratic assignment problem, M. Resende.

In the paper "Computing lower bounds for the quadratic assignment problem
with an interior point algorithm for linear programming," (Resende,
Ramakrishnan, and Drezner, O.R. 43 (781-791) 1995), compute an LP-based lower 
bound for the QAP using a interior point algorithm on numerous 
problems from the QAPLIB.  These linear programs are very difficult 
for direct factorization based LP solvers.
