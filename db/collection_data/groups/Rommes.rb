    notes: 'Power system models from Joost Rommes, Nelson Martins, Francisco Freitas

This collection of power system models originates from real power systems,
mostly based on Brazilian interconection power systems (BIPS) models (the file
names refer to the actual power system related to a given year electric load
scenario).  These systems [E dx/dt = Ax + Bu ; y=Cx + Du] are interesting
benchmarks for several numerical algorithms, including eigenvalue algorithms
(dominant modes/poles/zeros, stability analysis, computing rightmost
eigenvalues and/or with smallest damping ratio, eigenvalue parameter
sensitivity) and model order reduction (large-scale DAEs ). Refer to the
corresponding publications for more details on the systems and numerical
results of several eigenvalue/model order reduction algorithms. For
corresponding software, see http://sites.google.com/site/rommes/software

If E is not present in the problem, then E=I should be assumed.
If D is not present, D=0 should be assumed.  (Note that as of Jan 2011,
no problem has a nonzero D).

The iv vector in some of the files is a vector with nonzeros (ones) at indices
that represent state-variables (the zeros are algebraic variables). One can
construct the descriptor matrix E by E=spdiags(iv,0,n,n). This iv vector is
generated by the Brazilian power system simulation software, and can be more
efficient to compute with.


Test systems:

All power system models originate from CEPEL ( http://www.cepel.br/ )

Several SISO/MIMO test systems, whose main components are transmission lines
(TL) are available.  TLs are modeled by ladder networks, comprised of cascaded
RLC PI-circuits, having fixed parameters.

    Transmission lines with 10--80 PI Sections are considered.

    There are two kinds of files for representing a same system: the file with
    termination \'_n\' refers to an index-2 system DAE model, while \'_n1\' means
    a model of the same system, but for an index-1 DAE representation.  The
    representation of each test system has the form [E dx/dt = Ax + Bu ; y=Cx]
