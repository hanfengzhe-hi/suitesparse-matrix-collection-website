I put the files

bayer.tar.gz   
chem.tar.gz    
poli.tar.gz

in your subdirectory pub/faculty/davis/incoming

The matrices in bayer.tar.gz are of the german chemical industry
  (chemical process simulation). 

In chem.tar.gz you find matrices of demonstration examples of the
  chemical process simulator SPEEDUP.

The two matrices in poli.tar.gz are of account of capital links. The
  problem is:

Determine the inverse matrix of I-A. I is the unity matrix and A a matrix
  with elements a(i,j) and

	0 <= a(i,j) < 1

The elements b(i,j) of B = (I-A)**(-1) are >= 0. These matrices are
  very sparse and the fill in is very small.



Best Regards,
Friedrich Grund
