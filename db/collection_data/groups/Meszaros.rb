Linear Programming Test Problems

I\'m collecting linear programming problems (in MPS format, formulated as
minimization) for testing. You can find them in the following subdirectories of
http://www.sztaki.hu/~meszaros/public_ftp/lptestset:

    * NETLIB, contains the "usual" NETLIB LP problems.

    * KENNINGTON, contains the "Kennington" collection, also available from
      NETLIB.

    * INFEAS, infeasible LP problems (most of them are available from NETLIB).

    * STOCHLP, deterministic equvivalent of stochastic linear programming
      problems (mostly 2-stage models).

    * MISC, in which you can find a number of different LP problems not
      available from NETLIB.

    * PROBLEMATIC, in which you can find "problematical" problems. These
      problems are, usually the results of wrong modelling. In the README file
      you can find a short explanation about the modelling mistakes.

    * QPDATA, where you can find sets of convex quadratic testproblems. See the
      README for more details. NETLIB.

The problems are compressed in two levels. To uncompress them, you have to
gunzip the files and then use the empc utility to create the MPS file. Please
let you submit me your problems (if you have an interesting one) by sending me
a mail message.

I would like to emphasize my sincerely thanks to those people who helped me
to extend the MISC collection, namely to

    * Prof. G. Mitra at the Brunel University ,

    * Prof. T. Terlaky at the University of Technology Delft,

    * E.D. Andersen at the Univeristy Odensee.
