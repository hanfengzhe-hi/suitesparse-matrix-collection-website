    notes: 'Circuit simulation matrices from Tim Lehner, IBM EDA.
Added March, 2006.

The dc* matrices are DC operating point problems, and the trans* matrices
are transient simluations.  All come from the same circuit.  As in most
circuit matrices, these matrices are permutable into block triangular form,
and the also have a few dense rows/columns (normally from voltage and
current sources).
