connectus:
This is a matrix from Steven Buss, for a website recommendation system (to
be called www.connectious.com).  Each row of the matrix is a unique user.
Each column of the matrix is a web page.  A(i,j)=1 if user i has tagged
web page j as favorable, and a 0 represents no opinion.  The data was
obtained from digg.com.  Note that the matrix A*A\' contains one
connected component of size 342, and 170 singletons (nodes with no edges)
This means that a group of 341 users share some interests, at least
indirectly, and that there are 171 other users that share no interests
at all with any other users (they have no pages in common with anyone).

12month1: another matrix from the same problem, with 12,646 users
and 394,792 web pages, from July 2008 to July 2009.
