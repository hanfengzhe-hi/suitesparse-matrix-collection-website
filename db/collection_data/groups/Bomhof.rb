    notes: 'Matrices from circuit simulation problems.  Wim Bomhof, Univ. Utrecht.

Modelled as a system of differential algebraic equations.
Normally solved with a BDF method, and Newton\'s method, which
give rise to linear systems that need to be solved.  A, x, and b
are provided.

that develops a finite element code for geomechanical problems.

Added to the UF sparse matrix collection in December 2001.
