    notes: 'Circuit simulation matrix from Emrah Acar, IBM Austin.  High degree of coupling.

From Emrah Acar, IBM Research-Austin

this matrix failed in umd4[umfpack4.0], ma28 takes forever, sparse1.3
is slower than umd2, haven\'t tested in 4.3.  The matrix is from transient
simulation of a timing path. The circuit contains a high level of coupling.

Results from Tim Davis:
On a 3.2Ghz Pentium 4, UMFPACK v4.0 takes 7.4 seconds (backslash in
MATLAB 6.5).  UMFPACK v4.3 takes 0.20 seconds.
