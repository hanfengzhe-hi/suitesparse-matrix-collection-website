Notes on the graphs in the UF Collection:

    The node labels have not been imported into the UF Collection,
    since they are not yet compatible with the UF format.
    They are available at the http://law.di.unimi.it/index.php site
    as separate files.

    The MATLAB Problem.A matrix is stored in double precision, but
    these files are all binary.  These graphs are also quite huge.
    If you have problems with memory usage, you can convert the
    graphs to the logical format.  For example:

        Problem = UFget (\'LAW/uk-2002\') ;
        A = logical (Problem.A) ;
        clear Problem

    The above transformation will temporarily take additional space,
    but once the transformation is made, A will be about half as
    big as the original Problem.A.  This will free up memory for
    other algorithms to operate on the graph (assuming that they
    can operate on logical sparse matrices).

For a complete list of the graphs in the LAW collection, and
for a wealth of statistical data on the graphs, please
