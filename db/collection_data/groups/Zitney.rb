Chemical engineering applications.  The rdist* matrices are discussed in:

Zitney, S. E., "Sparse matrix methods for chemical process separation
calculations on supercomputers," in Proc. Supercomputing \'92, pp. 414-423,
(Minneapolis, MN, November 16-20, 1992), IEEE Computer Society Press, Los
Alamitos, CA, 1992.


These matrices come from a nonlinear solver, so they represent a selection
from a sequence of matrices with similar values and pattern.

Minor change: 3/31/03.  "rua" changed to "RUA" in the headers of each matrix.
