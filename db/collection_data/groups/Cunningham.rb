qa8fk:  Finite element stiffness matrix for a 3D acoustic problem.
qa8fm:  Mass matrix for the above problem.
Both matrices are symmetric.

The MATLAB version of qa8fk and qa8fm includes the 3D coordinates of
the nodes of the matrix as Problem.coord.  They appear here as *.xyz.gz
files.  See ../Pothen/README.txt for a description of the xyz file format.

k3plates:  Finite element mass matrix, 3 plates meeting at a line
m3plates:  mass matrix for the above problem.

Submitted to the UF sparse matrix collection in January, 2002.
