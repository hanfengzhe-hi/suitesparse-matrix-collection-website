    notes: 'Numerical simulation of coating flows, from Jim Brethour.

Original data was sent with 12 decimal digits in the mantissa, thus
the 4E20.12 format for the numerical values.

Jim Brethour writes:

"Problems such as ours, incompressible 
free-surface flows, with (in my case) deformable boundaries, represent 
practical problems where direct solvers are typically the best way to go.
The large system is for the tail end of a converging slot 
coater (418 elements) and the smaller is for a 64 element lid-drvien cavity."
